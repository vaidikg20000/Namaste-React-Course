## Session 3- 
- React uses key concept to map the children in the dom tree for more efficiency
- React.createElement => Object => HTML (DOM)
- JSX is HTML LIKE SYNTAX INSIDE JS.
- JSX (Babel converts this into createElement)=> React.createElement => Object => HTML (DOM)

# Functional Component:
- Functional Component is a JS Function that returns some piece of JSX, or a composition of react element, or a react component. 
- It's name starts with capital letter (not mandatory, but it is a good practice to use it).
- Functional components can be passed into one another using <Title /> or {Title()}, this is called component composition, basically it is passing components inside components
- {......} we can write any piece of JS code inside those curly braces.
